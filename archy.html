<h1>Archy</h1>

<p>Archy is my second OC, a very small Dovabrodian with a very big heart.</p>

<h2>Basic details</h2>

<p>
Archy's age is unknown, measuring only 15cm tall (head to feet), 45cm long (nose to tail), and a wingspan of 60cm.
<br><br>
Archy features golden scales with white underbelly scales, blue eyes, blue mouth and tongue, and bright orange tipped feathers along his body, tail, and wings.
<br><br>
Has the ability to change his size, as well the size of objects of his choosing that he is in contact with. The process can consume a lot of energy (energy used grows exponentially as he gets bigger). Due to the energy used he prefers being his usual size, only using the ability when the situation calls for it.
