<h1>Archy</h1>

<p>Archy is my second OC, a very small Dovabrodian with a very big heart.</p>

<h2>Basic details</h2>

<p>
Archy's age is unknown, measuring only 15cm tall (head to feet), 45cm long (nose to tail), and a wingspan of 60cm.
<br><br>
Archy features golden scales with white underbelly scales, blue eyes, and bright orange tipped feathers along his body, tail, and wings.
<br><br>
Archy has the ability to change his size, with the downside that the process consumes a lot of energy. Due to the amount of energy used he prefers being his usual size, using the ability only when the situation calls for it.</p>
