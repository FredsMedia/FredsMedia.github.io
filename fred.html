<h1>Fred</h1>
 
 <p>Fred is my first ever OC, intended to represent me as much as possible. He does not belong to a specific species.</p>

  <h2>Basic details</h2>

   <p>Fred is roughly 20 years old and measures 0.7m tall (head to feet), 2.1m long (nose to tail), and has a wingspan of 2.4m.

   Fred is mainly light brown, with darker brown eyebrows and eye rings(?), silver scales along his belly and lower leg, blue eyes, white face, translucent ghost hands, as well as black glasses frames.

   He is adventurous, cheery, social, and always willing to lend a hand.
   
   Fred has a pair of ghost hands that can be summoned and dismissed at will, the hands are able to interact with objects.
  
   Fred can also control his external body temperature, the bounds of the ability unknown but it can consume a lot of energy - especially when used for long periods of time.</p>

  <h2>Backstory</h2>

   <p>Fred's egg was an Amazon delivery that got lost in transit and left the in wild to hatch alone. He learnt basic Australian English from observation of nearby communities and was adopted by one where he gained social abilities and further english language development. He quickly found interest in technology and gained his passion for electronics.</p>
